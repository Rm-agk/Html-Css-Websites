              <h3>Headset Overview</h3>
              <p> This headset will be similar to the normal virtual reality headsets but with special in-built features. The main function of this headset is to allow someone to relive moments in their memories through a simulation. The headset will come with sensors that are to be placed around the body. The benefits of this headset are to bring joy to people’s lives (the headset will have an inbuilt filter to prevent horrifying times in one’s life from being projected). The headset is mainly for use in hospitals and mental health clinics and therapists. The headset will be controlled using an app, this app will have access to the memories of the user (with the user's permission).</p>
