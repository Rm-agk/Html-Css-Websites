            <h2>Market Research</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The global VR headsets market size is 
              anticipated to value approximately 20 
              billion USD until 2025. The 3 companies 
              that dominate the VR headset market are, 
              Sony, Oculus, and HTC. 80% of the 1 million 
              orders made in 2017 were either from Sony, 
              Oculus, or HTC. This just shows how much 
              they dominate the market. There are many 
              companies out there that offer great VR 
              headsets, so if you want to be at the top 
              you need to be different. Many are similar 
              so, the more unique it is the better. The 
              market for VR headsets is massive. I think 
              the VR headsets target everyone, not only 
              gamers. This means that no matter which 
              direction you go, the audience will still be 
              there.

            <h2>How to use</h2>
            <br>

              our target market to anyone who is able to install

              make people enjoy happy moments in their lives 
              and be able to go back and create a simulation of 
              what was to them the happiest moments in their 
              lives. After paying the subscription, instructions on how to download the app will be sent to the customer's email.</p>
