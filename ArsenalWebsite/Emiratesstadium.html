                <h3>The change to the Emirates</h3>
                <p>Arsenal’s match day revenue increased from £37.4m in their old Highbury stadium to over £90m in the new Emirates Stadium (equivalent to an additional income of over £1m per match), and that excludes other commercial revenue; converting Highbury to residential units delivered £157m in 2011 alone. This financial success meant Arsenal could clear all their bank loans in 2010</p>
